# Hey Mack!

I used create react app to get this project up and running. There is information below that should direct you to the documentation for React and how to start the site on your machine.

Please modify, remove, or add anything to/from this project that you want!
If you have any questions for me let me know.

## Goals

1. Create a site that keeps track of climbs that are currently are up on a section at one of the circuits. Once one gym is implemented, it will _probably_ be reasonable to add other locations.

2. Allow users to add climbs to a log, possibly multiple logs. For example, to-do, done, something else? Maybe i'm overthinking this.

3. Create a backend application that supports users data be sustained

   - I have some experience with backend but it has been a long time so I need to brush up on that.

4. Maybe eventually implent an app.
   - I have never made an app but react native seems to be pretty popular and I am pretty sure it is cross platform.

## Functionality to (_eventually_) implement

### Section

1.  Develop a section view/page.
2.  Develop support for multiple sections.
3.  Develop a way to add climbs to the section if you are an admin.

### Climb

1.  Create a climb view/page that displays info on climb, circuit-given grade, climber-given grade, average climber given grade, video/photo section, etc

Below is default information provided by create react app

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
