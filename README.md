# Hey Mack!

I used create react app to get this project up and running. There is information below that should direct you to the documentation for React and how to start the site on your machine.

Please modify, remove, or add anything to/from this project that you want!
If you have any questions for me let me know.

## Goals

1. Create a site that keeps track of climbs that are currently are up on a section at one of the circuits. Once one gym is implemented, it will _probably_ be reasonable to add other locations.

2. Allow users to add climbs to a log, possibly multiple logs. For example, to-do, done, something else? Maybe i'm overthinking this.

3. Create a backend application that supports users data be sustained

   - I have some experience with backend but it has been a long time so I need to brush up on that.

4. Maybe eventually implent an app.
   - I have never made an app but react native seems to be pretty popular and I am pretty sure it is cross platform.

## Functionality to (_eventually_) implement

### Section

1.  Develop a section view/page.
2.  Develop support for multiple sections.
3.  Develop a way to add climbs to the section if you are an admin.

### Climb

1.  Create a climb view/page that displays info on climb, circuit-given grade, climber-given grade, average climber given grade, video/photo section, etc
